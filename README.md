# XML DOM Example

This simple HTML page demonstrates how to use the XML DOM to fetch and display data from an XML file using JavaScript.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Click the "Get Books" button to load data from the 'books.xml' file.
3. The titles of the books will be displayed in an ordered list (`<ol>`).
4. Even-numbered list items have a light salmon background color.

## Code Overview

The code uses XMLHttpRequest to fetch data from the 'books.xml' file asynchronously. The XML data is then parsed using the XML DOM, and the titles of the books are extracted and displayed on the webpage.
